# Overview 

This GitHub repository contains the code that we used during the IMC Prosperity 3 algorithmic trading challenge. The IMC Prosperity 3 Algorithmic Trading Challenge was an international, two-week online competition organized by IMC Trading. Participants work in teams and act as representatives of virtual islands in a simulated trading world. Their goal is to write algorithms that buy and sell fictional products (like resin, kelp, squid ink, etc.) to earn as much virtual currency ("SeaShells") as possible. The game runs in five rounds, each adding more complex financial products (like ETFs and options) and trading challenges. While the main focus is on algorithmic trading, there are also manual trading tasks that test quick thinking and decision-making. Itâ€™s designed to be educational and fun, giving students and early-career participants a hands-on feel for real-world trading strategies and markets. Below you can find our strategy for the individual products.
